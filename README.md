Introduction
The Marketing Team tasked us with analyzing the performance of the Superhero U Facebook ad campaigns. Our goal was to identify underperforming campaigns and recommend improvements or discontinuations. Using data visualizations, we assessed the campaigns across several performance metrics, including Cost Per Result (CPR), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost Per Click (CPC), and the relationship between Clicks and Reach.

Methods and Tools
Our team used Power BI and Python (Jupyter Notebook) to visualize and analyze the data. The following metrics were evaluated to measure performance:

Cost Per Result (CPR): Assesses campaign efficiency. Higher CPR indicates underperformance.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): Measures engagement effectiveness. Low CTR suggests poor audience interaction.
Cost Per Click (CPC): Highlights cost efficiency of ad clicks. High CPC signals potential targeting or content issues.
Clicks vs. Reach: Evaluates conversion of ad visibility into user interaction.

Findings
Cost Per Result (CPR) by Campaign
Campaigns targeting UAE and UK students exhibited significantly higher CPR than others, indicating inefficiency in converting ad spend into results.
Clicks vs. Reach by Campaign
The UAE and UK campaigns showed a high reach but relatively low clicks, suggesting weak audience engagement despite visibility.
Click-Through Rate (CTR) by Campaign
UAE and UK campaigns had below-average CTR, highlighting a lack of compelling ad content or poor targeting.
Cost Per Click (CPC) by Campaign
CPC for UAE and UK campaigns was notably higher, further demonstrating inefficiency in generating cost-effective clicks.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend discontinuing the following campaigns:

Campaign 9 - SHU_Students (UAE):
High CPR and CPC.
Low CTR and clicks despite decent reach.

Campaign 10 - SHU_Students (UK):
Similar inefficiencies as UAE, with high-cost metrics and weak engagement.
Campaign 3 â€“ SHU_Students Australia
These campaigns are consuming disproportionate resources without achieving satisfactory results. Refocusing efforts on better-performing campaigns or optimizing these campaigns' content and targeting may yield improved outcomes.

Conclusion
Our analysis highlights the importance of aligning ad content with audience interests and optimizing cost efficiency. The Australia, UAE and UK campaigns stand out as underperformers, and their removal will streamline marketing efforts, enabling better resource allocation for high-impact campaigns.
